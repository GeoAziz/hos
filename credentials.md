# Admin Credentials

This file contains the default credentials for the admin user.

**Email:** `admin@medibook.com`
**Password:** `admin123`

You can use these credentials to log in to the admin dashboard at the `/login` route.

To create this user programmatically if they don't exist, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run setup:admin
```
